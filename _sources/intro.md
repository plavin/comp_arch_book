Phase Analysis in SST
============================

This book will explain how we're phase analysis tools to the Structural Simulation Toolkit.

## Goals

### Code Deliverables

We have two main code deliverables to our project which will be implemented for/in SST.

1. Add a phase analysis component that is able to send notifications to listeners about phases. These messages may include 
   * New phases
   * Phase changes
   * Phase change predictions
1. Create a tool that can take the phases that are identified and translate this back into code in the original source file. 

### Research Deliverables
With a sutiable interface for phase detection implemented in SST, we will enable several studies to be performed:

1. A comparitive study of online phase analysis techniques
1. A study of the kernels within different apps that stand out performance wise

### Enabled Research
1. A suitable phase detection component is required to implement our model swapping work in SST
1. A suitable phase to code translator will enable us to auto generate benchmarks for Spatter.
