Computer Architecture: A Hands-On Approach
============================

Computer architecture is the study of how computers are architected. 

This book will take a hands-on appraoch, with examples taking advantage of the Structural Simulation Toolkit (SST). 

This is a living documnent: while we don't expect the early chapters on basic topics to change frequently, we intend to continuously add new chapters and sections as components are added to SST.
